    "The `sys_df` dataframe from question 3 should now be a little easier to read and use, but there are some strange things we would like to fix about the formatting of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The three features or columns all contain numeric data (seconds, GB, and MB) but are currently formatted as Strings with redundant information also contained in the column names. Fix the dataframe so that each value is just an integer. Note that the rows at index `400` and on have System Time recorded in minutes instead of seconds, be sure to convert these to seconds by mulitplying by 60.\n",
    "2. Currently the System Memory is split accross two columns, one for the GB and one for the MB. For example, the total memory of the first program is 3 GB and 414 MB. Instead, represent the full system memory in the `System Memory MB` column, and get rid of the `System Memory GB` column. To do so, you need to convert the values in the GB column to MB (1 GB is 1000 MB) and add that to the MB column, then use the [`drop` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) to remove the GB column.\n",
    "3. Now that you have dealt with the above, it should be easy to provide some basic statistics about the data. Report the mean time in seconds and mean memory in MB of the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished, again run `sys_df.head()` to show the first few rows of your dataframe, and print or report your answer to the third task."
